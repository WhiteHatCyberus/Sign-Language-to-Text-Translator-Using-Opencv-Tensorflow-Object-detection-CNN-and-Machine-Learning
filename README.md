# Sign-Language-to-Text-Translator
We have used concepts of machine learning, computer vision, object detection, and cnn (convolutional neural networks)

# Instructions
1. If you intend to create gestures or run the translator, its advisable to run firstpage.py (Main UI made using Tkinter modules) within "Main menu and creation of datasets"<br><img width="310" alt="Screenshot 2022-09-07 110715" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70995581/188797226-64fc042c-4768-4f56-9858-f54deb096804.png" class="center">

2. We have trained the MNIST dataset CNN model with Tensorflow Object Detection API. 
3. The obtained accuracy of trained model is 99.3%.
4. Note: This accuracy was obtained with 20 epochs
5. Feel free to reduce the number of epochs to 5 or 10, accuracy may be 94-96%, which is sufficient.
6. When you run the translator, make sure your background has minimal disturbances and noise.
